## Project Overview
Netflix is a leading global streaming platform with a constantly expanding library of original and licensed content. This project analyzes Netflixâ€™s content catalog to identify trends, strengths, gaps, and opportunities. Using data science techniques, it provides actionable insights to guide content strategy, marketing, and recommendation improvements.

## Key Features
- Analyze trends in movies and TV shows, genres, ratings, countries, and release years.
- Clean and preprocess dataset to handle missing values and duplicates.
- Visualize patterns and distributions using interactive charts.
- Generate insights on popular genres, regional trends, and content gaps.
